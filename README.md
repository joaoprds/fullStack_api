In each part of the project you will analyze the README.md to be able to upload the project.

1. What would be your first improvements if you had more time to implement?
   A: I would create a user authentication and creation system to be able to perform product deletion and creation operations, separate the product creation and viewing screens and add more filters for searching for products.

2. Thinking about your solution, what would maintenance be like if new product categories were added? What would need to be changed?
   A: to add products, simply fill in the products tab on the frontend and it will be added to the database, to add categories, simply add to the Database

3. What changes would need to be made to support updates to the product category discount
   percentage so that whenever the discount percentage was changed, the new price would be
   reflected across all products in the same category?
   A: make the change in the Service file so that the calculation is carried out automatically
